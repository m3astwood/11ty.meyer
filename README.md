# Fondation Meyer

Site built on 11ty. Config based on [1itvinka's SCSS Starter](https://github.com/1itvinka/11ty-scss-starter) and tweaked after looking at [5t3phanie Eckles' starter](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-sass-skeleton/).

## Dev Notes

```sh
npm i
```

To run the project watching changes, including changes from your SCSS :

```sh
npm run start
```

It will be available at [http:///localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) by default.
